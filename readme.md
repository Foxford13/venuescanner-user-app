#venuescanner-test
Installation
To run this code you will need to have bower, npm and gulp
Simply run "bower install && npm install" then "gulp" to start it

#####Where is it hosted:

Im hosting it on heroku and the link is https://venuescanner-test.herokuapp.com/users
and the api is https://venuescanner-test.herokuapp.com/api/users

FYI Applications hosted on heroku for free tend to be very slow

#####Technologies used

I build the backend using Node.js with Express framework.
After realising that front end might be needed i quickly added AngularJS framework.
The database is done using MongoDB and Mongoose

#####Things to improve
This is a very basic MVP and if not for a time constraint I definitely would have added authentication for admins.
Another aspect i would have improved was the form validation on the front end without those alert popups.
